# [](#description) Course Description

This course is intended as a specialized course on models and techniques for decision making in autonomous agents, such as intelligent robots, that must function in rich interactive settings involving environments with other agents and people.

This course will cover decision theoretic algorithms, interactive decision making including game theoretic techniques, learning in games and social settings, as well as selected topics involving decentralized systems. We will also look at aspects of human decision making, both to ask what people actually do and to consider what agents must do in light of this.

Issues of intelligent and fluid interaction by autonomous robots/agents, operating in environments including other strategic agents (either other autonomous agents or people), are becoming increasingly more important - with the advent of systems that routinely embody rich and sophisticated multi-modal interfaces, making it possible for us to now consider issues of interactive behaviour. At the same time but from a seemingly opposite perspective, 'market design' approaches are becoming increasingly more suitable to the needs of collections of individually simple robots and agents (and people) that must work together on sophisticated large scale tasks.

The content of this course has connections to other courses within our existing curriculum, such as Reinforcement Learning and Algorithmic Game Theory. A noteworthy difference is that this course will focus more heavily on issues of modelling - how tasks associated with robotics and autonomous agents could/should be expressed and analysed using the formal language of these models, and also have more coverage of learning and potential connections to mechanisms of (boundedly rational) human decision making. This course will be self contained, discussing salient algorithmic techniques associated with some of the major models being considered. However, we expect this knowledge to be complemented by the more detailed discussion of techniques in the Reinforcement Learning and Algorithmic Game Theory and its Applications. Similarly, students will benefit from prior exposure to robotics at the level of the Robotics:Science and Systems (or some equivalent exposure to autonomous agent design), which provides the perspective necessary to fully appreciate the concerns of this course.
